				Welcome!
			</h5>
			<p>Hey, you found my blog. I suppose I'll take this opportunity to welcome you to my new website. I hope all my pseudo-intellectual, Dunning-Kruger-esque rants don't scare you off too quickly. That said, I honestly don't know who in their right mind would actually <i>want</i> to read what I post here. My guess is that the majority of my audience will be those that I tell about my website, and make the mistake of actually visiting it. I suppose it will be a fun game though, I might see if I can tell who has and hasn't visited it by the number of funny looks they give me.</p>
			<p>Anyway, as for the content I will be posting about here, I have a few ideas in mind. Primarily I'll be reviewing things, such as books, albums, or other pieces of media I find entertaining. But don't fret! I'll also be posting my fair share of political opinions for you to get angry about. Occassionally I may post jokes, songs I write and record, or anecdotes from my life, although I doubt these will be of much interest to anyone other than myself. After all I'm not particularly funny, musically gifted, or interesting.</p>
			<p>Finally, I would like to state the purpose of this blog. If you have read the home page, you will have noted that this site is to act as a replacement for my social media (Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, and Facebook). In practice this means that it's simply a method through which I can speak my mind and share my thoughts. Just like with social media, I don't know why anybody cares about what I post, but I like to tell people about my life anyway. Hopefully this will be healthier for me, and for everyone else that doesn't have to put up with my posts. So I suppose you're welcome, this way you can simply "unfollow" me by not reading this blog, and I will be none the wiser.</p>
			<p>So for those of you that care, welcome to my blog.</p>
