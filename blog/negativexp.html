				NegativeXP - Not the Punk Rock we need, but the Punk Rock we deserve
			</h5>
			<p>I recently came across a song titled "<a href="https://youtu.be/TSKizLRFbTo">Scott Pilgrim vs. the World Ruined a Whole Generation of Women</a>", by an indie-punk artist that goes by the name of "NegativeXP". The unofficial unofficial music video of which has over 4 million views, but the total number of listens is difficult to calculate given that several uploads have been taken down by YouTube and other platforms. The song itself is a critique of a certain type of woman, one that, by the artist's own description identifies with, and shares many characteristics with, the character "Ramona Flowers" from the 2010 movie "<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446029/">Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</a>". The song itself is a brash, offensive, unappologetic criticism of these Ramona Flowers types, describing them as having "bright dyed hair, and obnoxious clothes", "retarded views on politics", a "flouride mind", and perhaps most controversially, being a "whore". Given these lyrics, it is of course easy to understand why this song recieved such a negative reception by so many, and yet it would be far too easy, and frankly too stupid stupid to simply brand NegativeXP a sexist, an incel, and a bigot. I believe that this song, and others by the same artist, are a perfect focal point for discussing a far more nuanced and complicated social issue.</p>

<p>Before I delve into this, however, I want to paint a better picture of who the artist, NegativeXP actually is. Outside of his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC23rBbRXpeK5xUAFhGzBZaA">YouTube channel</a>, <a href="https://www.negativexp.com/">website</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/shooter72244165/">Twitter</a>, I couldn't find much on him, <a href="https://youtu.be/lFXxbYJ_vDo">aside from one interview</a> on "The Dick Show". The interview itself is a car crash, I can confidently say that I watched it so that you don't have to... It's not good at all. The interview consists of nearly 23 minutes of a loud, insufferable, misogynist of a host talking over NegativeXP, as he describes just how good he feels the song is at describing all women, misunderstanding that the song itself was not intended as a criticism of women, but of a certain <i>type</i> of woman. At one point, NegativeXP even states "I do hate women, but I hate people in general", clarifying that his hatred for women is not unique, but simply a part of his wider hatred for all people, regardless of gender. However the end of the quote isn't easy to hear due to the host loudly exclaiming his approval of the words "I do hate women". This suggests to me that NegativeXP is not a Misogynist, but rather a Misanthropist. Sure, the song was a hate-fueled rant about the many Ramona Flowers of society, but NegativeXP has released hate-fueled rants about men as well, see "Toonami Ruined a Whole Generation of Manchildren". Yet I see nobody claiming that he is a Misandrist, for some reason nobody seems to care about this song in the same way that they do his other tracks that primarily target women - perhaps it just doesn't make as good a headline. But clearly the artist's anger is targeted at modern society in general, especially certain groups that exist within it. It's just not as simple as "NegativeXP hates women" and those claiming as such are being dissingenuous.</p>

<p>As for the title, I would now like to explain why I feel this way about NegativeXP and his music. The very idea of Punk Rock is that it's indepndenent, aggressive, anti-establishment, and most importantly, offensive. And NegativeXP is nothing if not offensive. Pop-Punk bands such as Green Day or Blink-182 somehow became the new Punk Rock architype, with lyrics even your grandmother would approve of. It's a far cry from the likes of John Lyndon, or even more extreme contemporaries such as GG Allin. And for all the offense that NegativeXP causes, it's clearly getting under the skin of those with power. You need look no further than the plethora of platforms that have banned, shadow-banned, or refused to pay him. To see that the system (for lack of a better term) widely dissapproves of NegativeXP just about says it all. And the excuses for all this deplatforming are nothing short of ridiculous double standards. Plenty of industry-approved artists have written songs that contain overtly sexist or otherwise offensive themes, and yet the mainstream does not dissaprove. For examples, Gun N' Roses have written a number of sexist or otherwise offensive songs, but none quite as offensive as the song "One In A Million", which contains lyrics which are openly racist, homophobic, and xenophobic. I'm not talking subtleties either, I'm talking <a href="https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/gunsnroses/oneinamillion.html">hard-Rs and faggots</a>. Despite this, Gun N' Roses enjoy plenty of revenue from all mainstream streaming services to this day. And this theme isn't localized to 80s Hard Rock bands either. Stormzy's hit single "Vossi Bop" includes lines wherein Stormzy raps about having sex with someone else's girlfriend, and boats about it as thought the woman was merely used as a tool through which he can gain more credibility.</p>

<p>So why can Guns N' Roses and Stormzy get away with it, when NegativeXP cannot? It's clear that there exists a double standard, but it's not extremely clear <i>why</i> there's a double standard. I do however, have a pretty good theory as to why. Guns N' Roses have since adopted a female member, Slash and Axl Rose both have admitted that the band was once sexist and that their songs contain sexist themes, and Axl Rose <a href="https://twitter.com/axlrose/status/127962421053772595">openly critiques the Trump administration</a>. Stormzy can objectity women because he <a href="https://youtu.be/iZ3PTJ7gWoM">demanded Theresa May help the Grenfell victims</a>, and proclaimed "Fuck Boris". Eminem can rap about <a href="https://genius.com/Eminem-kill-you-lyrics">raping his mother</a> and <a href="https://genius.com/Eminem-97-bonnie-and-clyde-lyrics">murdering his ex-wife</a> because he advocates for Black Rights, and criticises Trump. John Lennon could beat women and <a href="https://genius.com/John-lennon-woman-is-the-nigger-of-the-world-lyrics">use the N-word</a> because he advocated for world-peace and feminism. It appears that the gatekeepers will allow just about anything, so long as virtue-signalling is packaged alongside it. NegativeXP on the other hand, challenges what many feel comfortable with by not embracing any messaged deemed acceptable by the corporate and political elite. When a concept we approve of is challenged, our first response is not to question it, but to defend it. So when NegativeXP refers to Hollywood as "Pedowood", many jump to defend all the great things that their favourite actors or directors do, disregarding the fact that the entire industry is a hub of corruption, corporatism, elitism, and fickle virtue signalling - exactly what Punk Rock should be rebelling against right now.</p>

<p>I do feel that it is important for me to clarify that I do not share NegativeXP's views, from a purely ideological perspective I disagree with almost everything he has to say. I do not share his missanthropy, pessmism, or hatred for the world, at least not to the same extent that he does. But nontheless I love the fallout every time a song such as "<a href="https://youtu.be/3UC9eoAE0QE">Girls Are Dumb</a>" is released, not because I agree, but because I love to watch the reaction each and every time. I love to <a href="https://youtu.be/JG-UVv8cZ9s">watch the journalists seethe</a> and frantically try to silence it. Because regardless of the content of his lyrics, we still haven't yet learn our lesson about not silencing those that we disagree with. We still haven't learnt that shutting down hateful ideas only causes them to ferment and spread further. This isn't the Punk Rock we need right now, but it is the Punk Rock we deserve.</p>
