				Who are you? Why does this website exist?

			<p>Social media sucks, and it has done for a while now. Whilst I'm no neuroscientist, sociologist, or psychologist, and I'm certainly not educated enough on the subject to tell you why <i>you</i> shouldn't be using social media, I've read enough on the topic to come to the conclusion that social media usage is, in most cases, incredibly unhealthy both for individuals, and for society. As such, instead of shoving all my opinions down your throat through the regular channels, I'll save my degeneracy to be consumed at your own discresion. If you really want to give me likes, dislikes, or to just leave an anrgy comment, I have an email for that, and perhaps we can have a productive discussion rather than the dehumanizing, mob-driven bullshit seen on the likes of twitter and similar platforms.</p>
			<p>As for who I am, I'm just a guy. I'm 18 and I currently live in Wiltshire. I write and record songs from time to time, which I might share here if I work up the confidence. I like listening to extreme metal, among other more accessible genres of music. Other interests of mine include Philosophy and Existentialism, Free Open Source Software, and Politics, which I hope to study next year at university.</p>
